{"id":"NetworkView-eij","title":"Phase 1: Extract Core Domain (Pure Logic)","description":"## Goal\n\nCreate pure domain modules for spatial queries WITHOUT changing existing code. This phase is LOW RISK - we're only adding new modules, not modifying anything.\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n4-6 hours\n\n## What to Build\n\nCreate 3 new modules in `public/js/spatial/core/`:\n\n### 1. query.js - Domain Model\n\n**Purpose:** Pure data structure for spatial queries\n\n**Key Features:**\n- SpatialQuery class with constructor\n- toJSON() / fromJSON() for serialization\n- describe() for human-readable description\n- No dependencies on global state or DOM\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nexport class SpatialQuery {\n  constructor({ find, condition, distance, target, blocks = [] }) {\n    this.find = find;\n    this.condition = condition;\n    this.distance = distance;\n    this.target = target;\n    this.blocks = blocks;\n  }\n  \n  toJSON() { /* serialize */ }\n  static fromJSON(obj) { /* deserialize */ }\n  describe() { /* human-readable string */ }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. validator.js - Validation Logic\n\n**Purpose:** Validate queries before execution\n\n**Key Features:**\n- validateQuery(query, context) returns array of error strings\n- assertValid(query, context) throws ValidationError\n- Context includes { point, boundary, spatialReady }\n- Validation rules:\n  - Required fields (find, target, distance \u003e= 0)\n  - Target-specific (point required for selected_point)\n  - Block validation (type, operator, value)\n  - Controlled impurity accepted (checks spatialReady)\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nexport const validateQuery = (query, context = {}) =\u003e {\n  const errors = [];\n  if (!query.find) errors.push(\"'find' is required\");\n  if (query.target === \"selected_point\" \u0026\u0026 !context.point) {\n    errors.push(\"Point required for selected_point target\");\n  }\n  // ... more validation\n  return errors;\n};\n```\n\n### 3. compiler.js - Query Compilation\n\n**Purpose:** Transform query to execution format\n\n**Key Features:**\n- compileQuery(query, context) returns compiled object\n- Versioned contract (semver: \"1.0.0\")\n- Hash for caching (hashQuery helper)\n- Metadata includes compilation context\n- Calls assertValid() before compiling\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nexport const compileQuery = (query, context = {}) =\u003e {\n  assertValid(query, context);\n  \n  return {\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n    find: query.find,\n    blocks: [/* transformed blocks */],\n    metadata: { compiled_at, context },\n    hash: hashQuery(query)\n  };\n};\n```\n\n## Refactoring Practices\n\n**CRITICAL - Follow AGENTS.md:**\n\n1. **Do NOT modify existing code** - Only create new files\n2. **Backup before starting:**\n   ```bash\n   cp -r public/js/spatial /tmp/spatial_backup\n   ```\n\n3. **Test-driven development:**\n   -

{"id":"NetworkView-94q","title":"Phase 2: Extract Infrastructure (SQL/DuckDB)","description":"## Goal\n\nRefactor SQL generation and DuckDB execution to remove global state dependencies. This is MEDIUM RISK - we're changing existing modules but keeping compatibility.\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n6-8 hours\n\n## What to Build\n\nRefactor 2 existing modules into `public/js/spatial/infrastructure/`:\n\n### 1. sql.js → infrastructure/sql-builder.js\n\n**Changes:**\n- Remove `import { state }` - accept context via parameter\n- Change function signatures to accept context object\n- Keep same SQL generation logic\n- Add explicit error messages when required context missing\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\n// spatial/sql.js\nimport { state } from \"../state/manager.js\";\n\nexport const buildPointDistanceWhere = (point, distance, relation) =\u003e {\n  const useSpatial = state.spatialReady \u0026\u0026 state.geometryField; // Global access\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\n// spatial/infrastructure/sql-builder.js\n// No state import\n\nexport const buildPointDistanceWhere = (point, distance, relation, context) =\u003e {\n  const { spatialReady, geometryField, bboxReady, bboxFields } = context;\n  const useSpatial = spatialReady \u0026\u0026 geometryField; // From parameter\n  // ... same logic\n};\n```\n\n**Functions to refactor:**\n- buildPointDistanceWhere(point, distance, relation, context)\n- buildBoundaryWhere(operator, boundary, context)\n- buildAttributeWhere(operator, value, context)\n- buildSpatialWhere(compiled, point, context)\n- expandPointToBbox(point, distance) - no context needed, pure\n\n### 2. runner.js → infrastructure/duckdb-runner.js\n\n**Changes:**\n- Remove `import { state }` - accept db and context via parameters\n- Change loadSpatialLogicRunner to factory function\n- Accept signal for cancellation support\n- Return execution metadata (mode, time, post-filtered)\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\n// spatial/runner.js\nimport { state } from \"../state/manager.js\";\n\nexport const loadSpatialLogicRunner = async (config, setStatus) =\u003e {\n  return {\n    async run(compiled, point, duckdb) {\n      const tableName = state.bboxReady ? \"routes_with_bbox\" : \"...\"; // Global\n      // ...\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\n// spatial/infrastructure/duckdb-runner.js\n// No state import\n\nexport const createDuckDBRunner = (db, context) =\u003e {\n  return {\n    async execute(whereClause, options) {\n      const { signal, needsPostFilter, point, distance } = options;\n      const { bboxReady, serviceIdField, geojsonField } = context;\n      \n      // Check cancellation\n      if (signal?.aborted) throw new Error(\"Query cancelled\");\n      \n      const tableName = bboxReady ? \"routes_with_bbox\" : \"...\"; // From context\n      // ... execute query\n      \n      return {\n        serviceIds: [...],\n        count: ...,\n        executionTime: ...,\n        postFiltered: ...\n      };\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n## Compatibility Layer\n\nCreate `public/js/spatial/compatibility/adapter.js`:\n\n**Purpose:** Bridge between old and new infrastructure modules\n\n```javascript\n// compatibility/adapter.js\nimport { state } from \"../state/manager.js\";\nimport { buildSpatialWhere } from \"../infrastructure/sql-builder.js\";\nimport { createDuckDBRunner } from \"../infrastructure/duckdb-runner.js\";\n\n/**\n * Adapter for old code that doesn't pass context\n * Uses global state to build context (temporary)\n */\nexport const buildSpatialWhereCompat = (compiled, point) =\u003e {\n  const context = {\n    spatialReady: state.spatialReady,\n    geometryField: state.geometryField,\n    bboxReady: state.bboxReady,\n    bboxFields: state.bboxFields,\n    operatorFields: state.operatorFields,\n    modeField: state.modeField\n  };\n  return buildSpatialWhere(compiled, point, context);\n};\n\nexport const createRunnerCompat = (db, setStatus) =\u003e {\n  const context = {\n    bboxReady: state.bboxReady,\n    serviceIdField: state.serviceIdField,\n    geojsonField: state.geojsonField,\n    bboxFields: state.bboxFields\n  };\n  return createDuckDBRunner(db, context);\n};\n```\n\n**Update existing code to use adapter:**\n- runner.js → imports from adapter.js\n- app.js → imports from adapter.js (temporarily)\n\n## Refactoring Practices\n\n**CRITICAL - Follow AGENTS.md:**\n\n1. **Backup before changing:**\n   ```bash\n   cp public/js/spatial/sql.js /tmp/sql_backup.js\n   cp public/js/spatial/runner.js /tmp/runner_backup.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Find ALL call sites:**\n   ```bash\n   # Find all calls to buildSpatialWhere\n   grep -rn \"buildSpatialWhere\" public/\n   \n   # Find all calls to loadSpatialLogicRunner\n   grep -rn \"loadSpatialLogicRunner\\|runner\\.run\" public/\n   ```\n\n3. **Update signatures incrementally:**\n   - Create new infrastructure modules first\n   - Create compatibility adapter\n   - Update call sites one at a time\n   - Test after each update\n   - Remove old modules last\n\n4. **Verify no undefined errors:**\n   ```bash\n   # After changes, check browser console\n   # Look for \"is not defined\" errors\n   # Check Network tab - ensure new files loaded\n   ```\n\n5. **Test continuously:**\n   ```bash\n   # After EVERY change\n   npm test -- spatial-sql\n   \n   # Run in browser, check console\n   # Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R\n   ```\n\n6. **Git commits:**\n   ```bash\n   git add public/js/spatial/infrastructure/sql-builder.js tests/sql-builder.test.js\n   git commit -m \"Extract SQL builder to infrastructure layer\n\n   - Remove global state dependency\n   - Accept context via parameter\n   - Add tests for context-based SQL generation\n   - Keep compatibility with adapter\"\n   \n   git add public/js/spatial/infrastructure/duckdb-runner.js tests/duckdb-runner.test.js\n   git commit -m \"Extract DuckDB runner to infrastructure layer\n   \n   - Remove global state dependency\n   - Add cancellation support via AbortSignal\n   - Return execution metadata\n   - Keep compatibility with adapter\"\n   \n   git add public/js/spatial/compatibility/adapter.js\n   git commit -m \"Add compatibility adapter for gradual migration\n   \n   - Bridges old code to new infrastructure\n   - Uses global state temporarily\n   - Will be removed in Phase 5\"\n   ```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n**Update existing tests + add new ones:**\n\ntests/spatial-sql.test.js → tests/sql-builder.test.js:\n- Update to pass context parameter\n- Add tests for missing context (should error clearly)\n- Verify same SQL generated with context\n- Test cancellation support\n\nNew tests/duckdb-runner.test.js:\n- Test runner creation with context\n- Test cancellation via signal\n- Test execution metadata returned\n- Mock DuckDB connection\n\n**Run tests:**\n```bash\nnpm test -- sql-builder\nnpm test -- duckdb-runner\n\n# Verify all old tests still pass\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] public/js/spatial/infrastructure/sql-builder.js created\n- [ ] public/js/spatial/infrastructure/duckdb-runner.js created\n- [ ] public/js/spatial/compatibility/adapter.js created\n- [ ] No direct state imports in infrastructure modules\n- [ ] All functions accept context via parameter\n- [ ] Cancellation support added (AbortSignal)\n- [ ] Tests updated and passing\n- [ ] Compatibility adapter tested with existing code\n- [ ] Browser console shows no errors\n- [ ] All 34+ existing tests still pass\n- [ ] Committed and pushed to branch\n\n## Call Site Updates\n\n**Files to check/update:**\n- public/js/spatial/runner.js (use adapter temporarily)\n- public/app.js (use adapter temporarily)\n- tests/spatial-sql.test.js (update to new signatures)\n\n**Pattern for updates:**\n```javascript\n// OLD\nconst sql = buildSpatialWhere(compiled, point);\n\n// NEW (via adapter -

Clear layer separation\n2. Single source of truth (one state.spatial object)\n3. Unidirectional data flow\n4. Dependency inversion (inject dependencies, not global access)\n5. Explicit execution model (cancellable, versioned queries)\n6. Strong validation (fail fast at boundaries)\n7. Loose coupling via events (fan-out only, not core logic)\n\n**Architecture Decisions:**\n- Controlled impurity accepted at boundaries (spatial rules need context)\n- Cancellation support - \"latest result wins\" for concurrent edits\n- Query caching - hash-based cache for performance\n- Versioned contracts - compiled queries are stable, serializable\n- Events for side effects only - core execution stays synchronous/debuggable\n\n## Approach\n\n**Parallel Operation Strategy:**\n- No big-bang rewrite\n- Run old and new architecture side-by-side\n- Feature flag: config.features.spatial_new_architecture\n- Compatibility shims for gradual cutover\n- Comprehensive testing at each phase\n- Only remove old code after new is proven\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Architectural Health:**\n- Coupling: \u003c20% modules with global state access (currently ~80%)\n- Test Coverage: \u003e90% (currently ~50%)\n- Cyclomatic Complexity: \u003c10 per function (builder.js has \u003e15)\n\n**Developer Experience:**\n- Time to add feature: \u003c2h (currently unpredictable)\n- Regression rate: \u003c10% (currently ~40%)\n\n## References\n\n- SPATIAL_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md - Complete architectural analysis\n- AGENTS.md - Refactoring guidelines\n- plan.md - Discovery log\n\n## Phases\n\nSee child tasks for detailed phase breakdown (6 phases, 34-48h total)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-28T19:35:29.201596Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T19:35:29.201596Z"}

{"id":"NetworkView-cni","title":"Phase 4: Refactor UI Layer (Presentation Only)","description":"## Goal\n\nSeparate UI presentation from business logic in builder.js. This is HIGHER RISK - we're changing a large file with many responsibilities.\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n8-12 hours\n\n## Current Problem\n\nbuilder.js (515 LOC) mixes:\n- UI rendering (DOM manipulation)\n- Event handling\n- Business logic (validation, compilation)\n- State management\n- External dependencies (metadata access)\n\n## What to Build\n\nSplit builder.js into focused modules:\n\n### 1. ui/builder-ui.js - Presentation Only\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- DOM manipulation\n- Event listeners\n- UI state (local only - which tab, expanded sections)\n- Emit events (no direct calls to business logic)\n\n**Does NOT:**\n- Validate queries\n- Compile queries\n- Execute queries\n- Access global state directly\n\n**Pattern:**\n```javascript\nexport const createBuilderUI = (container, { onQueryChange, onRun, getMetadata }) =\u003e {\n  // UI elements\n  const elements = { /* ... */ };\n  \n  // Local UI state\n  const uiState = {\n    activeTab: \"builder\",\n    blocks: []\n  };\n  \n  // Event handlers emit events\n  elements.run.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e {\n    const query = getCurrentQueryFromUI();\n    onRun(query); // Callback, not direct service call\n  });\n  \n  elements.distance.addEventListener(\"input\", () =\u003e {\n    const query = getCurrentQueryFromUI();\n    onQueryChange(query); // Callback\n  });\n  \n  return {\n    setQuery(query) { /* Update UI from query */ },\n    setError(errors) { /* Display validation errors */ },\n    disable() { /* Disable during execution */ },\n    enable() { /* Re-enable */ }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n### 2. ui/builder-state.js - Local UI State\n\n**Purpose:** Manage UI-specific state (not query state)\n\n```javascript\nexport const createBuilderState = () =\u003e {\n  const state = {\n    activeTab: \"builder\",\n    blocks: [],\n    expanded: true\n  };\n  \n  const listeners = [];\n  \n  return {\n    get() { return { ...state }; },\n    set(updates) {\n      Object.assign(state, updates);\n      listeners.forEach(cb =\u003e cb(state));\n    },\n    subscribe(callback) {\n      listeners.push(callback);\n      return () =\u003e {\n        const index = listeners.indexOf(callback);\n        if (index \u003e -1) listeners.splice(index, 1);\n      };\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Migration Strategy\n\n**Incremental Approach:**\n\n1. **Create new UI modules first** (don't delete builder.js yet)\n2. **Wire new UI behind feature flag**\n3. **Test both UIs side-by-side**\n4. **Migrate event handlers one at a time**\n5. **Remove old builder.js last**\n\n**Backup:**\n```bash\ncp public/js/spatial/builder.js /tmp/builder_original.js\n```\n\n**Extract functions incrementally:**\n```bash\n# 1. Extract DOM manipulation to builder-ui.js\n# 2. Extract state management to builder-state.js\n# 3. Move event handlers to builder-ui.js\n# 4. Replace business logic calls with callbacks\n\n# After each step, test:\nnpm test\n# Check browser console\n```\n\n### 4. Wiring Pattern\n\n**Old (builder.js):**\n```javascript\ninitSpatialLogicBuilder(container, {\n  onChange: (compiled) =\u003e { /* ... */ },\n  onRun: (compiled) =\u003e { /* ... */ }\n}, runner);\n```\n\n**New (builder-ui.js + service):**\n```javascript\nif (useNewArchitecture) {\n  const builderUI = createBuilderUI(container, {\n    onQueryChange: (query) =\u003e {\n      spatialService.updateQuery(query);\n    },\n    onRun: async (query) =\u003e {\n      const result = await spatialService.executeQuery(query);\n      if (!result.success) {\n        builderUI.setError(result.errors);\n      }\n    },\n    getMetadata: () =\u003e state.metadata\n  });\n  \n  // Subscribe to service events\n  spatialEventBus.on(\"spatial:complete\", () =\u003e {\n    builderUI.enable();\n  });\n  \n  spatialEventBus.on(\"spatial:error\", (error) =\u003e {\n    builderUI.setError([error.message]);\n    builderUI.enable();\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Refactoring Practices\n\n**CRITICAL - Follow AGENTS.md:**\n\n1. **Never delete without verification:**\n   ```bash\n   # Before deleting ANY function from builder.js\n   grep -n \"^const functionName\\|^function functionName\" public/js/spatial/ui/*.js\n   \n   # Only delete if found in new modules\n   ```\n\n2. **Function signature migration:**\n   ```bash\n   # Find ALL references to builder functions\n   grep -rn \"initSpatialLogicBuilder\\|spatialBuilder\\.run\" public/\n   \n   # Update each call site\n   ```\n\n3. **Test after EVERY extraction:**\n   ```bash\n   # After extracting each function group\n   npm test\n   \n   # Check browser\n   # Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R\n   ```\n\n4. **Git commits (atomic):**\n   ```bash\n   git add public/js/spatial/ui/builder-state.js tests/builder-state.test.js\n   git commit -m \"Extract builder UI state management\n   \n   - Separate UI state from query state\n   - Observable pattern for UI updates\n   - Tests for state mutations\"\n   \n   git add public/js/spatial/ui/builder-ui.js tests/builder-ui.test.js\n   git commit -m \"Extract builder UI presentation layer\n   \n   -

This is HIGHER RISK - changes affect entire app.\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n6-8 hours\n\n## Current Problem\n\n**4 Overlapping State Objects:**\n```javascript\n// state/manager.js\nstate.spatialBuilder      // Builder instance\nstate.spatialMatchSet     // Set\u003cstring\u003e\nstate.spatialQuery        // { active, serviceIds, point, pickingPoint }\n\n// builder.js (local)\nbuilder.state             // { find, condition, distance, blocks }\nbuilder.compiled          // Compiled query object\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- State can drift out of sync\n- Unclear which is source of truth\n- Redundant data (serviceIds in both matchSet and spatialQuery)\n\n## What to Build\n\n### 1. Single State Object\n\n**In state/manager.js:**\n```javascript\nstate.spatial = {\n  // Query definition (user-editable, source of truth)\n  query: {\n    find: \"routes\",\n    condition: \"within\",\n    distance: 300,\n    target: \"selected_point\",\n    blocks: []\n  },\n\n  // Execution state\n  execution: {\n    status: \"idle\", // idle | validating | compiling | running | complete | error\n    serviceIds: [],\n    count: 0,\n    error: null,\n    lastRun: null,\n    executionTime: null,\n    metadata: null\n  },\n\n  // UI state (ephemeral)\n  ui: {\n    point: null,              // { lat, lng }\n    pickingPoint: false,\n    showBuilder: true,\n    activeTab: \"builder\"\n  },\n\n  // Metadata cache (from config)\n  metadata: {\n    operators: [],\n    modes: [],\n    boundaries: []\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Migration Strategy\n\n**Incremental Migration:**\n\n1. **Add new state structure** (alongside old)\n2. **Create getters/setters** that write to both old and new\n3. **Update consumers one at a time** to read from new\n4. **Remove old state** after all consumers migrated\n5. **Remove compatibility shims**\n\n**Phase 1: Add New State**\n```javascript\n// state/manager.js\nexport const initializeSpatialState = () =\u003e {\n  state.spatial = {\n    query: { /* defaults */ },\n    execution: { /* defaults */ },\n    ui: { /* defaults */ },\n    metadata: { /* defaults */ }\n  };\n};\n\n// Call during app init\ninitializeSpatialState();\n```\n\n**Phase 2: Compatibility Setters**\n```javascript\n// Write to both old and new (temporary)\nexport const setSpatialMatchSet = (matchSet) =\u003e {\n  // OLD (keep for now)\n  state.spatialMatchSet = matchSet;\n  state.spatialQuery = {\n    ...state.spatialQuery,\n    active: matchSet !== null,\n    serviceIds: matchSet ? Array.from(matchSet) : []\n  };\n  \n  // NEW\n  state.spatial.execution = {\n    ...state.spatial.execution,\n    status: matchSet ? \"complete\" : \"idle\",\n    serviceIds: matchSet ? Array.from(matchSet) : [],\n    count: matchSet ? matchSet.size : 0\n  };\n};\n```\n\n**Phase 3: Update Consumers**\n```javascript\n// Find all readers of old state\ngrep -rn \"state\\.spatialMatchSet\" public/\ngrep -rn \"state\\.spatialQuery\" public/\ngrep -rn \"state\\.spatialBuilder\" public/\n\n// Update each to read from state.spatial\n// OLD\nconst ids = state.spatialQuery.serviceIds;\n\n// NEW\nconst ids = state.spatial.execution.serviceIds;\n```\n\n**Phase 4: Remove Old State**\n```javascript\n// After all consumers migrated, remove:\n// - state.spatialBuilder\n// - state.spatialMatchSet\n// - state.spatialQuery\n\n// Keep only:\n// - state.spatial\n```\n\n### 3. State Setters (New API)\n\n```javascript\n// Query setters\nexport const setSpatialQuery = (query) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.query = { ...state.spatial.query, ...query };\n};\n\n// Execution setters\nexport const setSpatialExecution = (execution) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.execution = { ...state.spatial.execution, ...execution };\n};\n\nexport const setSpatialStatus = (status) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.execution.status = status;\n};\n\nexport const setSpatialResults = (serviceIds) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.execution = {\n    ...state.spatial.execution,\n    status: \"complete\",\n    serviceIds,\n    count: serviceIds.length,\n    lastRun: new Date().toISOString()\n  };\n};\n\n// UI setters\nexport const setSpatialPoint = (point) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.ui.point = point;\n};\n\nexport const setSpatialPickingPoint = (picking) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.ui.pickingPoint = picking;\n};\n\n// Metadata setter\nexport const setSpatialMetadata = (metadata) =\u003e {\n  state.spatial.metadata = metadata;\n};\n```\n\n### 4. Service Integration\n\n**Update SpatialQueryService to use new state:**\n```javascript\n// Before\nthis.state.spatial.query = query;\nthis.state.spatial.execution = { ... };\n\n// Same, but now it's the ONLY state\n```\n\n**Remove compatibility adapter:**\n```javascript\n// spatial/compatibility/adapter.js\n// DELETE this file after migration complete\n```\n\n## Refactoring Practices\n\n**CRITICAL - Follow AGENTS.md:**\n\n1. **Backup before starting:**\n   ```bash\n   cp public/js/state/manager.js /tmp/state_manager_backup.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Find ALL state readers:**\n   ```bash\n   # Comprehensive search\n   grep -rn \"state\\.spatial\" public/\n   grep -rn \"state\\.spatialBuilder\" public/\n   grep -rn \"state\\.spatialMatchSet\" public/\n   grep -rn \"state\\.spatialQuery\" public/\n   \n   # Create a checklist\n   # Update each one, check off when done\n   ```\n\n3. **Update incrementally:**\n   ```bash\n   # 1. Add new state structure\n   # 2. Add compatibility setters\n   # 3. Update one consumer at a time\n   # 4. Test after EACH update\n   npm test\n   # Check browser console\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify no drift:**\n   ```javascript\n   // Add assertion during migration\n   if (state.spatial \u0026\u0026 state.spatialQuery) {\n     const newCount = state.spatial.execution.count;\n     const oldCount = state.spatialQuery.serviceIds.length;\n     if (newCount !== oldCount) {\n       console.error(\"[STATE DRIFT]\", { new: newCount, old: oldCount });\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Git commits (atomic):**\n   ```bash\n   git add public/js/state/manager.js\n   git commit -m \"Add unified spatial state structure\n   \n   - Single state.spatial object\n   - Replaces 4 overlapping objects\n   - Includes query, execution, ui, metadata\n   - Compatibility setters write to both old and new\"\n   \n   git add public/app.js\n   git commit -m \"Update app.js to read from unified spatial state\n   \n   - Read from state.spatial instead of old objects\n   - Compatibility setters still write to both\n   - No breaking changes\"\n   \n   git add public/js/spatial/\n   git commit -m \"Update spatial modules to use unified state\n   \n   - Service uses state.spatial\n   - UI uses state.spatial.ui\n   - Remove direct access to old objects\"\n   \n   git add public/js/state/manager.js\n   git commit -m \"Remove old spatial state objects\n   \n   - Delete state.spatialBuilder\n   - Delete state.spatialMatchSet\n   - Delete state.spatialQuery\n   - Only state.spatial remains\n   - Remove compatibility setters\"\n   ```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n**State Migration Tests:**\n```javascript\n// tests/spatial-state-migration.test.js\ndescribe(\"Spatial State Migration\", () =\u003e {\n  it(\"should have single spatial state object\", () =\u003e {\n    expect(state.spatial).toBeDefined();\n    expect(state.spatial.query).toBeDefined();\n    expect(state.spatial.execution).toBeDefined();\n    expect(state.spatial.ui).toBeDefined();\n  });\n  \n  it(\"should update execution state correctly\", () =\u003e {\n    setSpatialResults([\"id1\", \"id2\"]);\n    \n    expect(state.spatial.execution.status).toBe(\"complete\");\n    expect(state.spatial.execution.serviceIds).toEqual([\"id1\", \"id2\"]);\n    expect(state.spatial.execution.count).toBe(2);\n  });\n  \n  it(\"should not have old state objects\", () =\u003e {\n    expect(state.spatialBuilder).toBeUndefined();\n    expect(state.spatialMatchSet).toBeUndefined();\n    expect(state.spatialQuery).toBeUndefined();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Integration Tests:**\n```javascript\n// Verify no state drift\nit(\"should maintain state consistency across operations\", async () =\u003e {\n  const service = new SpatialQueryService({ state, eventBus, db });\n  \n  await service.executeQuery(query);\n  \n  // Check state is consistent\n  const { serviceIds, count } = state.spatial.execution;\n  expect(serviceIds.length).toBe(count);\n  \n  // No old state exists\n  expect(state.spatialMatchSet).toBeUndefined();\n});\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] state.spatial object created with query/execution/ui/metadata\n- [ ] All spatial modules use state.spatial\n- [ ] Old state objects removed (spatialBuilder, spatialMatchSet, spatialQuery)\n- [ ] No state drift (verified with tests)\n- [ ] All state readers updated (grep shows none reading old objects)\n- [ ] All state writers updated (setters use new API)\n- [ ] Compatibility adapter removed\n- [ ] Tests passing (state migration tests + existing tests)\n- [ ] Browser console shows no errors\n- [ ] Committed and pushed\n\n## Call Site Verification Checklist\n\nCreate checklist of all files to update:\n\n```bash\n# Generate checklist\ngrep -rn \"state\\.spatialBuilder\\|state\\.spatialMatchSet\\|state\\.spatialQuery\" public/ | \\\n  cut -d: -f1 | sort -u \u003e /tmp/spatial_state_files.txt\n\n# Files to update (example):\n# [ ] public/app.js\n# [ ] public/js/filters/builder.js\n# [ ] public/js/spatial/builder.js\n# [ ] public/js/spatial/execute.js\n# [ ] public/js/spatial/evidence.js\n```\n\n## Performance Validation\n\n**Verify no performance regression:**\n```javascript\n// Before and after migration\nconsole.time(\"query-execution\");\nawait service.executeQuery(query);\nconsole.timeEnd(\"query-execution\");\n\n// Should be similar or better\n```\n\n## References\n\nSPATIAL_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md section: \"Single State Object\"\nAGENTS.md section: \"Comprehensive Call Site Auditing\"\n\n## Parent Epic\n\nNetworkView-p5s\n\n## Depends On\n\nNetworkView-eij (Phase 1), NetworkView-94q (Phase 2), NetworkView-5tx (Phase 3), NetworkView-cni (Phase 4)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T20:19:40.221019Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T20:19:40.221019Z"}

{"id":"NetworkView-ubc","title":"Improve spatial query coverage and relation controls","description":"## Summary\\nSpatial queries are still missing services outside the local area (e.g., Aberdeen returns only 65 routes, dropping long-distance coach services) and the UI only lets you pick a point+radius; there is no way to choose whether the query should intersect, contain, or follow another relation. We need a more dataset-agnostic spatial filter experience that surfaces the right results for coast-to-coast services and gives users control over the relation.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n- Spatial queries return the expected set of services even when the radius spans large areas (e.g., Aberdeen example should include long-distance coaches once filters are configured appropriately).\\n- Builder UI exposes a dropdown (or similar control) to choose the spatial relation for each block (intersect/within/contains/touches), with a clear label that isn’t tied to routes, and updates the compiled state accordingly.\\n- Query generator honors the selected relation when building DuckDB SQL, including geometry and bbox fallbacks, so the backend can handle intersect/within/contain/touch without leaking route-specific terms.\\n- Document the new choices in the viewer help text so users know what each relation does and how it affects long-distance matches.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n- Depends on NetworkView-3uh (Spatial Query Tool epic)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-28T10:05:55.604207Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T10:05:55.604207Z"}
